My research examines how ecological and evolutionary forces maintain behavioral diversity, and how individual variation mediates species’ responses to human disturbance. I focus on how behavior scales from individuals to populations and communities, shaping resilience in managed and disturbed ecosystems.

### Behavioral variation and fitness tradeoffs
Using socially monogamous birds, I examine how individuals balance competing reproductive strategies and how these strategies interact with spatial context to shape fitness outcomes.

### Anthropogenic disturbance and social systems
My work on noise pollution and habitat modification shows that human disturbance can restructure social networks and alter behavioral interactions in ways that influence population dynamics.

### Methods, animal welfare, and policy relevance
I study how research tools themselves affect animals, translating behavioral and physiological data into methodological standards and policy-relevant thresholds.

### Translational conservation science
My current and future work focuses on applying behavioral insights to adaptive conservation management, including collaborative projects with state agencies and NGOs.
