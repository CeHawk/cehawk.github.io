title: Teaching & Mentorship
---

At its core, science is curiosity about the natural world. I help students develop flexible, evidence-based thinking and become comfortable with uncertainty in ecological systems.

### Teaching experience
- Instructor of Record: Animal Behavior (UC Davis)
- Adjunct Lecturer: Intro to Organisms & Populations (Tufts University)
- TA experience across ecology, animal communication, labs, and field courses

### Teaching approach
I emphasize observation, hypothesis-driven inquiry, and scientific communication. Students learn that biological variation is informative rather than problematic.

### Mentorship
I integrate students into all stages of the research process, from fieldwork to publication. Most of my first-author papers include undergraduate co-authors, and I prioritize transparent, inclusive access to research opportunities.
